In this tutorial we will use the latest data from the cryptocurrency markets to provide a hands-on and complete example that anyone can follow along with. 1.1 What will I learn? In this tutorial you will primarily learn about tools for the R programming language developed by RStudio and more specifically the tidyverse. If you are not familiar with these open source products, don’t worry. We’ll introduce these throughout the tutorial as needed. The focus of the tutorial is on supervised machine learning, a process for building models that can predict future events, such as cryptocurrency prices. You will learn how to use the caret package to make many different predictive models, and tools to evaluate their performance. Before we can make the models themselves, we will need to “clean” the data. You will learn how to perform “group by” operations on your data using the dplyr package and to clean and modify grouped data. You will learn to visualize data using the ggplot2 package, as well as some powerful tools to extend the functionality of ggplot2. You will gain a better understanding of the steps involved in any supervised machine learning process, as well as considerations you might need to keep in mind based on your specific data and the way you plan on acting on the predictions you have made. Each problem comes with a unique set of challenges, but there are steps that are necessary in creating any supervised machine learning model, and questions you should ask yourself regardless of the specific problem at hand. You will also learn a little about cryptocurrencies themselves, but this is not a tutorial centered around trading or blockchain technology. 1.2 Before Getting Started You can toggle the sidebar on the left side of the page by clicking on the menu button in the top left, or by pressing on the s key on your keyboard. You can read this document as if it were a book, scrolling to the bottom of the page and going to the next “chapter”, or navigating between sections using the sidebar. This document is the tutorial itself, but in order to make the tutorial more accessible to people with less programming experience (or none) we created a high-level version of this tutorial, which simplifies both the problem at hand (what we want to predict) and the specific programming steps, but uses the same tools and methodology providing easier to digest examples that can be applied to many different datasets and problems. 1.2.1 High-Level Version If you are not very familiar with programming in either R or Python, or are not sure what cryptocurrencies are, you should definitely work your way through the high-level version first. If you are an intermediate programmer we still recommend the high-level version first. Below is an embedded version of the high-level version, but we recommend using any of the links above to view it in its own window. Once in its own window it can be full-screened by pressing on the f button on your keyboard. When following along with the high-level tutorial embedded above, the results will be completely reproducible and the document is static and does not update over time meaning your results will exactly match those shown. The document you are currently reading this text on on the other hand updates every 12 hours. You will be able to access the same data source, but it updates hourly by the 8th minute of every hour with the most recent data, so this document and your results won’t perfectly match. Whenever text is highlighted this way, that means it is a snippet of R code, which will usually be done to bring attention to specific parts of the code. 1.3 Format Notes Are you a Bob, Hosung, or Jessica below? This section provides an example of how different users may want to approach the tutorial differently based on their levels of experience. You can hide the sidebar on the left by pressing the s key on your keyboard. The cryptocurrency data was chosen to produce results that change over time and because these markets don’t have any downtime (unlike the stock market). Whenever an R package is referenced, the text will be colored orange. We will discuss R packages and the rest of the terms below later in this document, but if you are not familiar with these terms please look through the high-level version first. Whenever a function is referenced, it will be colored green. Whenever an R object is referenced, it will be colored blue. We will also refer to the parameters of functions in blue. When a term is particularly common in machine learning or data science, we will call it out with purple text, but only the first time it appears. Whenever text is highlighted this way, that means it is a snippet of R code, which will usually be done to bring attention to specific parts of the code. 1.4 Plan of Attack How will we generate predictive models to predict cryptocurrency prices? At a high level, here are the steps we will be taking: Setup guide. Installation guide on getting the tools used installed on your machine. Explore data. What is the data we are working with? How “good” is the “quality”? Prepare the data. Make adjustments to “clean” the data based on the findings from the previous section to avoid running into problems when making models to make predictions. Visualize the data. Visualizing the data can be an effective way to understand relationships, trends and outliers before creating predictive models, and is generally useful for many different purposes. Definitely the most fun section! Make predictive models. Now we are ready to take the data available to us and use it to make predictive models that can be used to make predictions about future price movements using the latest data. Evaluate the performance of the models. Before we can use the predictive models to make predictions on the latest data, we need to understand how well we expect them to perform, which is also essential in detecting issues. 1.5 GitHub Repository This tutorial has a public GitHub Repository associated with it, which is not only a website for us to easily distribute all the code behind this document for others to view and use, but also where it actually runs. Every 12 hours, a process gets kicked off on the page associated with our project on GitHub.com and refreshes these results. You can view the latest runs as they execute over time here: https://github.com/ries9112/cryptocurrencyresearch-org/actions In the next section we will talk more about the GitHub Repository for this tutorial, for now you can check on the latest run history for this document, which is expected to update every 12 hours every day: https://github.com/ries9112/cryptocurrencyresearch-org/actions If you are running into problems using the code or notice any problems, please let us know by creating an issue on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ries9112/cryptocurrencyresearch-org/issues Go to the next section for instruction on getting setup to follow along with the code run in the tutorial. You can run every step either in the cloud on your web browser, or in your own R session. You can even make a copy of the GitHub Repository on your computer and run this “book” on the latest data (updated hourly), and make changes wherever you would like. All explained in the next section ➡️ 1.6 Disclaimer This tutorial is made available for learning and educational purposes only and the information to follow does not constitute trading advice in any way shape or form. We avoid giving any advice when it comes to trading strategies, as this is a very complex ecosystem that is out of the scope of this tutorial; we make no attempt in this regard, and if this, rather than data science, is your interest, your time would be better spent following a different tutorial that aims to answer those questions. "],["setup.html", "Section - 2 Setup and Installation 2.1 Option 1 - Run in the Cloud 2.2 Option 2 - Run Locally", " Section - 2 Setup and Installation Every part of this document can be run on any computer that has R installed You can also follow along with the tutorial without running the individual steps yourself. In that case, you can move on to the next page where the tutorial actually begins. 2.1 Option 1 - Run in the Cloud If you do not currently have R and RStudio installed on your computer, you can run all of the code from your web browser one step at a time here: this mobile friendly link. This can take up to 30 seconds to load, and once it has you should see a page that looks like this: From here, you can run the code one cell at a time: You can also use Shift + Enter to run an individual code cell Or run all code cells at once: If you feel lost and are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, you can do a quick interactive walkthrough under Help –&gt; User Interface Tour: 2.2 Option 2 - Run Locally If you want to follow along from your own computer directly (recommended option), please follow the installation instructions below. Afterwards, you will be able to run the code. You only need to follow these instructions once. If you have followed these steps once already, skip ahead to the next section. 2.2.1 Setup R If you do not already have R and R Studio installed on your computer, you will need to: Install R. Install RStudio. This step is optional, but it is very recommended that you use an integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio as you follow along, rather than just using the R console as it was installed in step 1 above. Once RStudio is installed, run the application on your computer and you are ready to run the code as it is shown below and in the rest of this document! You can run your code directly through the Console (what you are prompted to write code into when RStudio boots up), or create a new document to save your code as you go along: You will then be able to save your document with the .R extension on your computer and re-run your code line by line. 2.2.2 Installing and Loading Packages [ADD HERE] describe how to install packages, what they are, etc… like high-level version. install.packages(&#39;pacman&#39;) Load pacman: library(pacman) Install other packages: p_load(&#39;pins&#39;,&#39;tidyverse&#39;,&#39;skimr&#39;,&#39;tsibble&#39;,&#39;doParallel&#39;,&#39;DT&#39;, &#39;caret&#39;,&#39;anytime&#39;, # Data Exploration + Data Prep &#39;ggTimeSeries&#39;,&#39;gifski&#39;,&#39;av&#39;, &#39;magick&#39;, &#39;ggthemes&#39;, &#39;plotly&#39;, &#39;ggpubr&#39;, # Visualization &#39;ggforce&#39;,&#39;gganimate&#39;, &#39;transformr&#39;, # Visualization continued &#39;xgboost&#39;,&#39;gbm&#39;,&#39;deepnet&#39;) # Predictive Modeling Nice work! Now you have everything you need to follow along with this example. 2.2.3 GitHub Repository Because this document is produced through a free Continuous Integration (CI) tool called GitHub Actions, it is also really easy for anyone to use the same code on their own computer to produce this document using the latest available data (or even automate their own process). If you wanted to render this document in its entirety yourself, here is how you would do it using the application RStudio: Create a copy of the GitHub project on your own computer by clicking on the button in the top right of the user interface to create a New Project: Run the code install.packages('bookdown') to install the Bookdown package. Now you can run this document you are currently seeing on your own computer by running the command bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd'), which should take about one hour to execute. Once it is finished, the results will update in the **_book** folder, and you can view the document by clicking on any .html file contained within that folder. You can find more information around using and editing the bookdown format here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/introduction.html Feel free to open an issue on the GitHub Repository if you are running into any problems: https://github.com/ries9112/cryptocurrencyresearch-org/issues "],["explore-data.html", "Section - 3 Explore the Data 3.1 Pull the Data 3.2 Data Preview 3.3 The definition of a “price” 3.4 Data Quality", " Section - 3 Explore the Data 3.1 Pull the Data The first thing we will need to do is download the latest data. We will do this by using the pins package(Luraschi 2020), which has already been loaded into our session in the previous section. First, we will need to connect to a public GitHub repository (anyone can post their code to the GitHub website and make a “repository” with code for their project) and register the board that the data is pinned to by using the board_register() function: library(pins) library(skimr) board_register(name = &quot;pins_board&quot;, url = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/predictcrypto/pins/master/&quot;, board = &quot;datatxt&quot;) By running the board_register() command on the URL where the data is located, we can now “ask” for the data we are interested in, which is called hitBTC_orderbook: cryptodata &lt;- pin_get(name = &quot;hitBTC_orderbook&quot;) The data has been saved to the cryptodata object. 3.2 Data Preview Below is a preview of the data: Only the first 2,000 rows of the data are shown in the table above. There are 213701 rows in the actual full dataset. The latest data is from 2020-11-02. This is tidy data, meaning: Every column is a variable. Every row is an observation. Every cell is a single value relating to a specific variable and observation. The data is collected once per hour. Each row is an observation of an individual cryptocurrency, and the same cryptocurrency is tracked on an hourly basis, each time presented as a new row in the dataset. 3.3 The definition of a “price” When we are talking about the price of a cryptocurrency, there are several different ways to define it. Most people check cryptocurrency prices on websites that aggregate data across thousands of exchanges, and have ways of computing a global average that represents the current price of the cryptocurrency. This is what happens on the very popular website coinmarketcap.com, but is this the correct approach for our use case? Before we even start programming, a crucial step of any successful predictive modeling process is defining the problem in a way that makes sense in relation to the actions we are looking to take. If we are looking to trade a specific cryptocurrency on a specific exchange, using the global average price is not going to be the best approach because we might create a model that believes we could have traded at certain prices when this was actually not the case. If this was the only data available we could certainly try and extrapolate trends across all exchanges and countries, but a better alternative available to us is to define the price as the price that we could have actually purchased the cryptocurrency at. If we are interested in purchasing a cryptocurrency, we should consider data for the price we could have actually purchased it at. The way these markets work, is you have a constantly evolving order book, where traders can post specific trades they want to make to either sell or buy a cryptocurrency specifying the price and quantity. When someone posts a trade to sell a cryptocurrency at a price that someone else is looking to purchase it at, a trade between the two parties will take place. You can find an example of a live order book for the exchange we will be using here: https://hitbtc.com/btc-to-usdt Scroll down to view the information relating to the orderbooks: Let’s focus on the Market Depth Chart for now: Here, the x-axis shows the price of the cryptocurrency, with the lower prices on the left and the higher ones on the right, while the y-axis shows the cumulative volume (here in terms of Bitcoins) of orders that could currently be triggered on each side. In the screenshot above, around the $13,000 price point the market essentially “runs out” of people willing to buy the cryptocurrency, and shows us how much people are willing to sell at the higher price points. The screenshot shows there are many orders that are waiting to be fulfilled, around the $12,500 price point shown for example the chart tells us if we wanted to buy the cryptocurrency BTC at that price, about 1,500 BTC would have to be sold for more expensive prices before the order was triggered. The market will aggregate trades people want to perform based on the given prices, and fulfill orders from the orderbook of pending trades. The price at which the two sides of the orderbook converge is the price we could currently trade the cryptocurrency on this exchange at. Because the price works this way, we couldn’t simply buy 1,500 BTC at the $13,000 price point because we would run out of people who are willing to sell their BTC at that price point, and to fulfill the entire order we would need to pay more than what we would consider to be the “price” depending on how much we were looking to purchase. This is one of the many reasons for why any positive results shown here wouldn’t necessarily produce an effective trading strategy if put into practice in the real world. There is a meaningful difference between predicting price movements for the cryptocurrency markets, and actually performing effective trades, so please just have fun and experiment with the data but hold back the urge to use this to perform real trades. 3.3.1 In Summary To summarize the implications of what was explained above, the data we are using gives us the 5 nearest prices on both sides of where the red and green lines connect on the Market Depth Chart, as well as the quantity available to purchase or sell at that given price point. In order to make predictive models to predict the price of a cryptocurrency, we will first need to define the price as the lowest available price that allows us to buy “enough” of it based on the current orderbook data as described above. 3.4 Data Quality Before jumping into actually cleaning your data, it’s worth spending time doing some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is the process of analyzing the data itself for issues before starting on any other process. Most data science and business problems will require you to have a deep understanding of your dataset and all of its caveats and issues, and without those fundamental problems understood and accounted for no model will make sense. In our case this understanding mostly comes from understanding how the price of a cryptocurrency is defined, which we reviewed above, and there isn’t too much else for us to worry about in terms of the quality of the raw data, but in other cases doing EDA will be a more involved process doing things like visualizing the different columns of the data. There are a lot of tools that can be used for this, but as an example we can use one of the packages we already imported into the R session in the setup section called skimr(Waring et al. 2020) to get a quick overview/summary of the “quality” of the different columns that make up the data. We can use the skim() function on the cryptodata dataframe to get a summary of the data to help locate any potential data quality issues: skim(cryptodata) Table 3.1: Data summary Name cryptodata Number of rows 213701 Number of columns 27 _______________________ Column type frequency: character 5 Date 1 numeric 20 POSIXct 1 ________________________ Group variables Variable type: character skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max empty n_unique whitespace pair 0 1 5 9 0 214 0 symbol 0 1 2 6 0 214 0 quote_currency 0 1 3 3 0 1 0 pkDummy 460 1 13 13 0 2012 0 pkey 460 1 15 19 0 212961 0 Variable type: Date skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max median n_unique date 460 1 2020-08-10 2020-11-02 2020-09-22 85 Variable type: numeric skim_variable n_missing complete_rate mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist ask_1_price 43 1 33023.07 15143927.19 0 0.01 0.06 0.61 7000000000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_1_quantity 43 1 217293.97 5451535.54 0 18.90 430.00 3719.75 455776000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_2_price 83 1 241.91 7332.16 0 0.01 0.06 0.61 999999.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_2_quantity 83 1 235168.48 4930743.35 0 20.00 458.25 5200.00 459459000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_3_price 160 1 262.21 8123.80 0 0.01 0.06 0.61 999000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_3_quantity 160 1 288624.03 5315723.43 0 14.99 405.00 7090.00 518082000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_4_price 216 1 229729.79 40082727.37 0 0.01 0.06 0.61 7000000000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_4_quantity 216 1 303680.91 5231746.77 0 12.80 445.25 7640.00 546546000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_5_price 282 1 181.80 1389.66 0 0.01 0.07 0.63 24000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_5_quantity 282 1 310349.81 5568279.21 0 12.00 420.00 8614.20 549312000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_1_price 298 1 178.79 1376.80 0 0.00 0.05 0.53 20298.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_1_quantity 298 1 171237.10 2804582.16 0 30.00 683.00 7955.60 296583000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_2_price 357 1 178.63 1376.26 0 0.00 0.05 0.53 20269.5 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_2_quantity 357 1 176114.24 3360444.92 0 22.42 500.00 6198.48 562697873.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_3_price 359 1 178.32 1375.41 0 0.00 0.05 0.52 20231.5 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_3_quantity 359 1 239001.90 3415041.40 0 12.60 390.00 6070.00 347366000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_4_price 359 1 177.95 1374.42 0 0.00 0.04 0.49 20227.4 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_4_quantity 359 1 298639.22 3837900.90 0 10.00 380.00 7329.67 331285000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_5_price 361 1 177.43 1372.61 0 0.00 0.04 0.47 20210.4 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_5_quantity 361 1 348944.19 4588247.04 0 10.00 380.00 8400.00 384159000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ Variable type: POSIXct skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max median n_unique date_time_utc 460 1 2020-08-10 04:29:09 2020-11-02 05:03:24 2020-09-22 18:04:00 193025 This summary helps us understand things like how many null values are present in a given column and how those values are distributed.

One of the more popular tools introduced by the tidyverse is the %&gt;% operator, which works by starting with the object/data you want to make changes to first, and then apply each transformation step by step. It’s simply a way of re-writing the same code in a way that is easier to read by splitting the way the function is called rather than adding functions onto each other into a single line that becomes really hard to read. In the example above it becomes difficult to keep track of where things begin, the order of operations, and the parameters associated with the specific functions. Compare that to the code below: # Start with the object/data to manipulate cryptodata %&gt;% # Filter the data filter(symbol == &#39;BTC&#39;) %&gt;% # Select columns select(ts_index, price_usd, lagged_price_1h, lagged_price_24h, target_price_24h) %&gt;% # Print 30 elements instead of only default 10 for a tibble dataframe print(n = 30) %&gt;% # Show the last 30 elements of the data tail(30) ## [90m# A tibble: 2,018 x 6[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol [1][39m ## symbol ts_index price_usd lagged_price_1h lagged_price_24h ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dttm&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m 1[39m BTC 2020-08-10 [90m04:00:00[39m [4m1[24m[4m1[24m997.

The new field training flags the data as being part of the train dataset, or the test (or holdout for the first split) dataset for each of the 5 splits/datasets. Running the same code as before with tail() added, we should see rows associated with the test data of the 5th split (again remember, each of the 5 splits has a training and testing dataset): tail( select(cryptodata, training, split) ) ## [90m# A tibble: 6 x 3[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol, split [6][39m ## symbol training split ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m1[39m AAB holdout 5 ## [90m2[39m CRPT holdout 5 ## [90m3[39m REP holdout 5 ## [90m4[39m BYTZ holdout 5 ## [90m5[39m DAY holdout 5 ## [90m6[39m DCN holdout 5 The easiest way to understand these groupings, is to visualize them. In the next section, you will learn powerful tools for visualizing data in R. Do not worry if you do not understand the code below and are not familiar with ggplot(), we will explain this framework in the next section, for now review the charts below and try to follow along with the way we are grouping the data for the predictive models by looking at what the x and y axis represent, as well as the colors. On the x-axis we are plotting the DateTime of when a data point was collected, and on the y-axis the split (1-5) as described in this section. The data is then colored based on the category assigned for the training variable (“train”,“test” or “holdout”). We can visualize the new grouping variables: groups_chart &lt;- ggplot(cryptodata, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = split, color = training)) + geom_point() #+ #scale_y_reverse() # now show the chart we just saved: groups_chart We can check on the groupings for each cryptocurrency by animating the previous chart: library(gganimate) animated_chart &lt;- groups_chart + transition_states(symbol) + ggtitle(&#39;Now showing: {closest_state}&#39;) # show the new animated chart animate(animated_chart, fps = 2) If/when need to slow these down, use this code: (can’t change fps from 1 - or at least be careful, it’s error prone) animate(animated_chart, fps = 1) This is another tool that we will walk through in the next section. It can be a bit hard to tell how many data points there are because they end up looking like lines. Let’s change the plot to use geom_jitter() instead of geom_point(), which will manually offset the points and let us see exactly how many data points there are: animated_chart &lt;- animated_chart + geom_jitter() # show the new animated chart animate(animated_chart, fps = 2) 4.6 Fix Data by Split Now that we have split the data into many different subsets, those subsets themselves may have issues that prevent the predictive models from working as expected. 4.6.1 Zero Variance One of the first models we will make is a simple linear model. The regular R function for this will not work if the data contains any columns that have “zero variance”, meaning the value of the column never changes throughout the data being given to the model. Therefore, let’s fix any issues relating to zero variance columns in any dataset before we change the structure of the data in the step after this one. First change the grouping of the data, we are interested in calculating the zero variance based on the symbol, split and training fields. cryptodata &lt;- group_by(cryptodata, symbol, split, training) Now let’s create a new object called find_zero_var which shows the value of the minimum standard deviation across all columns and calculated based on the grouping of symbol, split and train. find_zero_var &lt;- select(mutate(cryptodata, min_sd = min(sd(price_usd, na.rm=T), sd(target_price_24h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_1h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_2h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_3h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_6h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_12h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_24h, na.rm=T))), min_sd) # Show data find_zero_var ## [90m# A tibble: 128,999 x 4[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol, split, training [980][39m ## symbol split training min_sd ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m 1[39m LEO 1 train 0.112 ## [90m 2[39m GBX 1 train 0.002[4m6[24m[4m5[24m ## [90m 3[39m ACT 1 train 0.000[4m6[24m[4m0[24m[4m6[24m ## [90m 4[39m MBL 1 train 0.000[4m0[24m[4m0[24m[4m6[24m46 ## [90m 5[39m BTG 1 train 0.395 ## [90m 6[39m ACAT 1 train 0.000[4m0[24m[4m1[24m[4m5[24m7 ## [90m 7[39m LINK 1 train 1.97 ## [90m 8[39m VET 1 train 0.000[4m8[24m[4m6[24m[4m1[24m ## [90m 9[39m IHF 1 train 0.003[4m2[24m[4m3[24m ## [90m10[39m DGB 1 train 0.002[4m1[24m[4m0[24m ## [90m# … with 128,989 more rows[39m Now let’s get to a list of cryptocurrency symbols where the minimum standard deviation across all columns for all splits of the data is 0, which is the list of cryptocurrencies to remove from the data. minimum_sd &lt;- filter(distinct(mutate(group_by(ungroup(find_zero_var), symbol), min_sd = min(min_sd, na.rm=T)), min_sd),min_sd &lt; 0.000001)$symbol # Show result minimum_sd ## [1] &quot;ACT&quot; &quot;MBL&quot; &quot;ACAT&quot; &quot;PAXG&quot; &quot;AYA&quot; &quot;DAY&quot; &quot;IPL&quot; &quot;APPC&quot; &quot;IHT&quot; ## [10] &quot;IQ&quot; &quot;CDT&quot; &quot;MESH&quot; &quot;NAV&quot; &quot;FDZ&quot; &quot;COCOS&quot; &quot;HTML&quot; &quot;SPC&quot; &quot;SBD&quot; ## [19] &quot;OAX&quot; &quot;GST&quot; &quot;CND&quot; &quot;DCN&quot; &quot;MG&quot; &quot;SWM&quot; &quot;PHX&quot; &quot;CUTE&quot; &quot;BCN&quot; ## [28] &quot;ELF&quot; &quot;BYTZ&quot; &quot;SENT&quot; &quot;WAXP&quot; &quot;IPX&quot; &quot;BNK&quot; &quot;CHAT&quot; &quot;WIKI&quot; &quot;NEU&quot; ## [37] &quot;ECA&quot; &quot;JST&quot; &quot;SEELE&quot; &quot;AAB&quot; &quot;CMCT&quot; Now we can remove these symbols from appearing in the dataset: cryptodata &lt;- filter(cryptodata, !(symbol %in% minimum_sd)) In the code above we match all rows where the symbol is part of the minimum_sd object with the list of cryptocurrency symbols to remove from the data, and we then negate the selection using the ! operator to only keep rows with symbols not in the list we found. 4.7 Nest data [ADD HERE] … explain goal and method … First make sure groupings are correct cryptodata &lt;- group_by(cryptodata, symbol, split, training) Example nesting data: nest(cryptodata) ## [90m# A tibble: 570 x 4[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol, training, split [570][39m ## symbol training split data ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;list&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m 1[39m LEO train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [233 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 2[39m GBX train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [208 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 3[39m BTG train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [297 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 4[39m LINK train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [219 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 5[39m VET train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [303 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 6[39m IHF train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [240 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 7[39m DGB train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [321 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 8[39m RCN train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [286 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m 9[39m LTC train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [321 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m10[39m NUT train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [303 × 11]&gt;[39m ## [90m# … with 560 more rows[39m First make training data nested: cryptodata_train &lt;- rename(nest(filter(cryptodata, training==&#39;train&#39;)), train_data = &#39;data&#39;) # Now remove training column cryptodata_train &lt;- select(ungroup(cryptodata_train, training), -training) # Fix issues with individual groups of the data cryptodata_train$train_data &lt;- lapply(cryptodata_train$train_data, na.omit) # Remove elements with no rows after na.omit step.

Give more background on those steps as “catch-alls”?] 4.8 Functional Programming [TODO - ADD HERE] –&gt; References "],["visualization.html", "Section - 5 Visualization 📉 5.1 Basics - ggplot2 5.2 Using Extensions", " Section - 5 Visualization 📉 Making visualizations using ggplot2 is one of the very best tools available in the R ecosystem. The gg in ggplot2 stands for the Grammar of Graphics, which is essentially the idea that many different types of charts share the same underlying building blocks, and that they can be put together in different ways to make charts that look very different from each other. In Hadley’s own words, “a pie chart is just a bar chart drawn in polar coordinates”, “They look very different, but in terms of the grammar they have a lot of underlying similarities.” 5.1 Basics - ggplot2 So how does ggplot2 actually work? “…in most cases you start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and coordinate systems (like coord_flip()).” - ggplot2.tidyverse.org/. Let’s break this down step by step. \"start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()) ggplot(data = cryptodata, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) The chart now shows up but is blank because we need to perform an additional step “You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram())…” We can take the exact same code as above and add + geom_point() ggplot(data = cryptodata, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + # adding geom_point(): geom_point() The most expensive cryptocurrency being shown, BTC in this case, makes it difficult to take a look at any of the other ones. Let’s try zooming-in on a single one by using the same code but making an adjustment to the data parameter to only show data for the cryptocurrency with the symbol ETH, first let’s filter the data down to those results only: eth_data &lt;- subset(cryptodata, symbol == &#39;ETH&#39;) ggplot(data = eth_data, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + geom_point() The axis automatically adjusted to the new data. This is better, but geom_point() might not be the best choice for this chart, let’s change geom_point with geom_line and see what that looks like: ggplot(data = eth_data, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + # changing geom_point() into geom_line(): geom_line() Let’s save the results as an object called crypto_chart: crypto_chart &lt;- ggplot(data = eth_data, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + geom_line() We can add a line showing the trend over time: crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + stat_smooth() crypto_chart One particularly nice aspect of using the ggplot framework, is that we can keep adding as many elements and transformations to the chart as we would like with no limitations. We will not save the next result, but to illustrate this point, we can add a new line showing a linear regression fit going through the data using stat_smooth(method = 'lm'). And let’s also show the individual points in green to show we can keep layering things as much as we want. crypto_chart + # Add linear regression line stat_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;, color=&#39;red&#39;) + # Add points geom_point(color=&#39;dark green&#39;, size=0.8) By not providing any method option, the stat_smooth() function defaults to use the method called loess, which shows the local trends, while the lm model fits the best fitting linear regression line for the data as a whole. Of course we can add other components that make a visualization effective, let’s add labels to the chart now: crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + ggtitle(paste(&#39;Price Change Over Time -&#39;, eth_data$symbol), subtitle = paste(&#39;Most recent data collected on:&#39;, max(eth_data$date_time_utc))) + xlab(&#39;Date Time (UTC)&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Price ($)&#39;) # display the new chart crypto_chart The ggplot2 package comes with a large amount of functionality. You can find a full reference of the functions you can use here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ What makes the ggplot2 package even better is the fact that it also comes with a framework for anyone to develop their own extensions. Meaning there is a lot more functionality that the community has created that can be added in importing other packages that provide extensions to ggplot. 5.2 Using Extensions 5.2.1 ggthemes To use an extension, we just need to import it into our R session like we did with ggplot2 and the rest of the packages we want to use. We already loaded the ggthemes (Arnold 2019) package in the Setup section so we do not need to run library(ggthemes) to import the package into the session. We can apply a theme to the chart now and change the way it looks: crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + theme_economist() # display the new chart crypto_chart See below for a full list of themes you can test. If you followed to this point try running the code crypto_chart + theme_excel() or any of the other options listed below instead of + theme_excel(): https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/ 5.2.2 plotly In some cases, it’s helpful to make a chart responsive to a cursor hovering over it. We can convert any ggplot into an interactive chart by using the plotly(Sievert et al. 2020) package, and it is super easy! We already imported the plotly package in the setup section, so all we need to do is wrap our chart in the function ggplotly(): ggplotly(crypto_chart) Use your mouse to hover over specific points on the chart above. Also notice that we did not overwrite the crypto_chart object, but are just displaying the results. If you are not looking to convert a ggplot to be interactive, plotly also provides its own framework for making charts from scratch, you can find out more about it here: https://plotly.com/r/ 5.2.3 ggpubr The ggpubr (Kassambara 2020) extension provides a lot of functionality that we won’t cover here, but one function we can use from this extension is stat_cor(), which allows us to add a correlation coefficient (R) and p-value to the chart. crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + stat_cor() # Show chart crypto_chart We will dive deeper into these metrics in the section where we evaluate the performance of the models. 5.2.4 ggforce The ggforce package (Pedersen 2020) is a useful tool for annotating charts. We can annotate outliers for example: crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + geom_mark_ellipse(aes(filter = price_usd == max(price_usd), label = date_time_utc, description = paste0(&#39;Price spike to $&#39;, price_usd))) + geom_mark_ellipse(aes(filter = price_usd == min(price_usd), label = date_time_utc, description = paste0(&#39;Price drop to $&#39;, price_usd))) When using the geom_mark_ellipse() function we are passing the data argument, the label and the description through the aes() function. We are marking two points, one for the minimum price during the time period, and one for the maximum price. For the first point we filter the data to only the point where the price_usd was equal to the max(price_usd) and add the labels accordingly. The same is done for the second point, but showing the lowest price point for the given date range. Now view the new chart: crypto_chart Notice that this chart is specifically annotated around these points, but we never specified the specific dates to circle, and we are always circling the maximum and minimum values regardless of the specific data. One of the points of this document is to show the idea that when it comes to data analysis, visualizations, and reporting, most people in the workplace approach these as one time tasks, but with the proper (open source/free) tools automation and reproducibility becomes a given, and any old analysis can be run again to get the exact same results, or could be performed on the most recent view of the data using the same exact methodology. 5.2.5 gganimate We can also extend the functionality of ggplot by using the gganimate (Pedersen and Robinson 2020) package, which allows us to create an animated GIF that iterates over groups in the data through the use of the transition_states() function. animated_prices &lt;- ggplot(data = mutate(cryptodata, groups=symbol), aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + geom_point() + transition_states(groups) + stat_smooth() + ggtitle(&#39;Price Over Time&#39;,subtitle = &#39;{closest_state}&#39;) + view_follow() # this adjusts the axis based on the group # Show animation (slowed to 1 frame per second): animate(animated_prices,fps=1) We recommend consulting this documentation for simple and straightforward examples on using gganimate: https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html 5.2.6 ggTimeSeries The ggTimeSeries (Kothari 2018) package has functionality that is helpful in plotting time series data. We can create a calendar heatmap of the price over time using the ggplot_calendar_heatmap() function. calendar_heatmap &lt;- ggplot_calendar_heatmap(eth_data,&#39;date_time_utc&#39;,&#39;price_usd&#39;) #or do target_percent_change here? calendar_heatmap DoW on the y-axis stands for Day Of the Week To read this chart in the correct date order start from the top left and work your way down and to the right once you reach the bottom of the column. The lighter the color the higher the price on the specific day. 5.2.7 Rayshader The previous chart is helpful, but a color scale like that can be a bit difficult to interpret. We could convert the previous chart into a 3d figure that is easier to visually interpret by using the amazing rayshader (Morgan-Wall 2020) package. This document runs automatically through GitHub Actions, which does not have a graphical environment to run the code below, which prevents it from refreshing the results with the latest data. We are showing old results for the Rayshader section below. If you have gotten to this point, run the code below yourself on the latest data to see this amazing package in action! # First remove the title from the legend to avoid visual issues calendar_heatmap &lt;- calendar_heatmap + theme(legend.title = element_blank()) # Add the date to the title to make it clear these refresh twice daily calendar_heatmap &lt;- calendar_heatmap + ggtitle(paste0(&#39;Through: &#39;,substr(max(eth_data$date_time_utc),1,10))) # Convert to 3d plot plot_gg(calendar_heatmap, zoom = 0.60, phi = 35, theta = 45) # Render snapshot render_snapshot(&#39;rayshader_image.png&#39;) # Close RGL (which opens on plot_gg() command in a separate window) rgl.close() This is the same two dimensional calendar heatmap that was made earlier. Because we can programmatically adjust the camera as shown above, that means that we can also create a snapshot, move the camera and take another one, and keep going until we have enough to make it look like a video!
